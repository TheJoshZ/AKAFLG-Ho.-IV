## 1.0 File Descriptions

### 1.1 Airfoils
Contains the 41 airfoils that were extracted from an Excel database. More could be extracted if necessary.  
The body foils are 3D scanned from the actual Horten IV itself, while the wing foils are from technical drawings.

### 1.2 HortenXFLR V7 Backup.xfl
Created in XFLR5 v6.61, the XFLR5 file contains all WIP models: a model with flaps, a model with varying Iyy values, and the base model called Horten IV V2, where I varied the CoG location from 1.3 to 1.55.

### 1.3 Standard Graphs
As the name implies, these are the standard graphs taken from XFLR5. There is a legend included in the images that shows the effect of moving the CoG on the short-period dynamics.

### 1.4 MIL-STD-1797A
Data from the Horten overlaid with MIL-STD-1797A for Category B flight phases (cruise).

### 1.5 MIL-F-8785C Data
Data from the Horten overlaid with MIL-F-8785C for Category B flight phases (cruise), showing Level 1 and Level 2 criteria (details in folder).
